This is an assignment which we performed to learn about the basics of UML diagrams.
The sample UML diagram is included in the folder and the java class I created is also located in the folder.
Some notable skills from this chapter were about reading the diagrams and applying object oriented principles to these diagrams.
My biggest takeaway was about making sure to listen to what the client wants specifically, including class names and method names.

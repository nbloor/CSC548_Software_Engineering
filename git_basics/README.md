This folder is dedicated to explaining the git commands that were most notable in implementing the project as well as explaining some of the core git ideas learned in CSC 548.

Some of the notable commands will be listed below. Similarly, in other files in the folder, I will attach screenshots of assignments and solutions from the course.

Notable git commands used:

git init - This command was used to initialize an instance of git which allowed collaboration between the two individuals on the project.
git add - This command was used to add files in preparation to be commited to the version history.
git commit - This command was used to commit the files which were in the staging area to the version history.
git log - This command was used to view the history of commits on the working project. This was used to return to a previous version by using the commit id.
git branch - This command was used to create a new working branch on the project. This was sued prior to pushing to main in order to ensure the project was working effectively/
git checkout - This was a shortcut command used to create a new branch and switch to it at the same time.
git status - This was used to double check the status of the staging area, seeing which files were in the staging area or not.
git push - This was used to push final commits to the origin which was the GitHub repository.
